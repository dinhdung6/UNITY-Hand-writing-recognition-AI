This is an English hand writing recognition AI in UNITY. In the script PopupManager.cs, you can manage the pop up text in the scene ( when and what the text are ). In the scene, click start to start the clock. At the right time, the text you program will pop up. Write the same letter with that pop up text and when the AI recognise it true, click capture and you will see the result true or false. If true you will receive points. This is the base mechanic of my game
